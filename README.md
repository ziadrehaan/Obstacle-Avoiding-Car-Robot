## 🔑 Key Features

- 🚧 **Obstacle Avoidance**  
  Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles automatically.

- 🎤 **Voice Control**  
  Accepts voice commands like `forward`, `left`, `stop`, etc., using voice recognition.

- 📱 **Bluetooth App Control**  
  Remote driving and mode switching via a Bluetooth-connected smartphone app.

- 🔁 **Multi-Mode Functionality**  
  Switch easily between auto-drive, voice control, and manual modes.

- 🔋 **Power Efficient**  
  Operates on a rechargeable battery with optimized power consumption.

- 🛠️ **Customizable**  
  Built with the Arduino platform for easy expansion and code modification.
